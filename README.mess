# About Lander
This is a simple Radiance module to provide a landing page. It allows you to configure any number of "panels" which can provide blocks of text or link to various features on your site.

The panels are easy to organise and style, and the page is cached on edit for fast serving. No database connection is required.

The only permission this system offers is ``lander``. Anyone with the permission can edit the landing page.
